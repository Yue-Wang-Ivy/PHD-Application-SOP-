In this repositories, I have organized three projects that I am involved in: White Matter fMRI, Infantile Esotropia , and Ferritin Surface Display.
Project 1: Whita Matter fMRI (sole first author)
Title: Direct coupling of brain structural and functional information within white matter: a unified framework (manuscript in preparation)
*Contributed to the proposal of innovative ideas during the initial phase
*Contributed to the development of the methodology
*Responsible for data preprocessing and code writing
*Responsible for the analysis of results and academic writing
(Since the paper has not yet been published, it is inconvenient to share the code and results.)
