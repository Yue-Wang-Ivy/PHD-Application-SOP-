# In this repository, I have organized three projects that I am involved in: White Matter fMRI, Infantile Esotropia and Ferritin Surface Display.

## Project 1: Whita Matter fMRI (sole first author)

## Title: Direct coupling of brain structural and functional information within white matter: a unified framework (manuscript in preparation)

## I also presented a poster at the OHBM conference.

### *Contributed to the proposal of innovative ideas during the initial phase /
### *Contributed to the development of the methodology /
### *Responsible for data preprocessing and code writing / 
### *Responsible for the analysis of results and academic writing / 
### (Since the paper has not yet been published, it is inconvenient to share the code and results.)

## Project 2: Infantile Esotropia (co-author)

## Title: Infantile esotropia: white matter alterations, recovery and age effect (manuscript in preparation)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/568bdfea-7065-485c-80ac-5e1c42668cc6)

### *Conducted data preprocessing and software debugging for the project /
### *Analyzed the changes in FA/MD related to infantile esotropia /
### (Since the paper has not yet been published, it is inconvenient to share the code and results.)

## Project 3: Ferritin Surface Display (project member)

## Title: Multivalent display technologies on protein nanoparticle surfaces: Design, construction and evaluation (project completed)

### *Contributed to the design of project content / 
### *Conducted hands-on project experiments / 
### *Contributed to the analysis of results 

## Project 4: Contrastive Machine Learning for Inherent Spatiotemporal Representations in Resting fMRl
### In progress.
### The gradient of neural receptors was calculated using python code and verified by spin test.
